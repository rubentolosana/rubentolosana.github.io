# (2021-2024) AI4Food

<p> 
<DIV align="left">
 <p><b>Title:</b> Inteligencia Artificial para la Prevención de Enfermedades Crónicas a través de una Nutrición Personalizada</p>
 <p><b>Type:</b> CAM Synergy Program</p>
 <p><b>Code:</b> Y2020/TCS6654</p>
 <p><b>Funding:</b> ca. 310 Keuros UAM (620 Keuros in total)</p>
 <p><b>Participants:</b> Univ. Autonoma de Madrid and IMDEA-Food Institute</p>
 <p><b>Period:</b> July 2021 - June 2024</p>
 <p><b>Principal investigator(s):</b> Javier Ortega-García (UAM technical lead: Aythami Morales)</p>
 <p><b>Objectives:</b></p>
 <p>- AI4Food will develop a series of enabling technologies to process, analyze and exploit a large number of biometric signals indicative of individual habits, phenotypic and molecular data.</p>
 <p>- AI4Food will integrate all this information and develop new machine learning algorithms to generate a paradigm shift in the field of nutritional counselling.</p>
 <p>- AI4Food technology will allow a more objective and effective assessment of the individual nutritional status, helping experts to propose changes towards healthier eating habits from general solutions to personalized solutions that are more effective and sustained over time for the prevention of chronic diseases.</p>
<p>- AI4Food will also advance knowledge on three questions using these new technologies: 1) WHICH are the sensor dependent and sensor independent biomarkers that work best for nutritional modelling of human behavior and habits? 2) WHEN, that is, under what circumstances (e.g., user habits, signal quality, context, phenotypic and molecular data), and 3) HOW can we best leverage those signals and context information to improve nutritional recommendations.</p>

# (2020-2023) TRESPASS-ETN

<p> 
<DIV align="left">
 <p><b>Title:</b> Training in Secure and Privacy-preserving Biometrics</p>
 <p><b>Type:</b> H2020 Marie Curie Initial Training Network</p>
 <p><b>Code:</b> H2020-MSCA-ITN-2019-860813</p>
 <p><b>Funding:</b> ca. 502 Keuros</p>
 <p><b>Participants:</b> UAM, Univ. Applied Sciences H-DA (Germany), Univ. Groningen (Netherlands), IDIAP (Switzerland), Chalmers Univ. (Sweden), Katholieke Univ. Leuven (Belgium)</p>
 <p><b>Period:</b> January 2020 – December 2023</p>
 <p><b>Principal investigator(s):</b> Massimiliano Todisco (Julian Fierrez and Aythami Morales for UAM)</p>
 <p><b>Objectives:</b></p>
 <p>- To combat rising security challenges, the global market for biometric technologies is growing at a fast pace. It includes all processes used to recognise, authenticate and identify persons based on biological and/or behavioural characteristics.</p>
 <p>- The EU-funded TReSPAsS-ETN project will deliver a new type of security protection (through generalised presentation attack detection (PAD) technologies) and privacy preservation (through computationally feasible encryption solutions).</p>
 <p>- The TReSPAsS-ETN Marie Sklodowska-Curie early training network will couple specific technical and transferable skills training including entrepreneurship, innovation, creativity, management and communications with secondments to industry.</p>
