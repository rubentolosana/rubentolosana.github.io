<p> 
<DIV align="left">
 <p><b>Title:</b> Inteligencia Artificial para la Prevención de Enfermedades Crónicas a través de una Nutrición Personalizada</p>
 <p><b>Type:</b> CAM Synergy Program</p>
 <p><b>Code:</b> Y2020/TCS6654</p>
 <p><b>Funding:</b> ca. 310 Keuros UAM (620 Keuros in total)</p>
 <p><b>Participants:</b> Univ. Autonoma de Madrid and IMDEA-Food Institute</p>
 <p><b>Period:</b> July 2021 - June 2024</p>
 <p><b>Principal investigator(s):</b> Javier Ortega-García (UAM technical lead: Aythami Morales)</p>
 <p><b>Objectives:</b></p>
 <p>- AI4Food will develop a series of enabling technologies to process, analyze and exploit a large number of biometric signals indicative of individual habits, phenotypic and molecular data.</p>
 <p>- AI4Food will integrate all this information and develop new machine learning algorithms to generate a paradigm shift in the field of nutritional counselling.</p>
 <p>- AI4Food technology will allow a more objective and effective assessment of the individual nutritional status, helping experts to propose changes towards healthier eating habits from general solutions to personalized solutions that are more effective and sustained over time for the prevention of chronic diseases.</p>
<p>- AI4Food will also advance knowledge on three questions using these new technologies: 1) WHICH are the sensor dependent and sensor independent biomarkers that work best for nutritional modelling of human behavior and habits? 2) WHEN, that is, under what circumstances (e.g., user habits, signal quality, context, phenotypic and molecular data), and 3) HOW can we best leverage those signals and context information to improve nutritional recommendations.</p>

 <p><b>Funding:</b> ca. 502 Keuros</p>
 <p><b>Participants:</b> UAM, Univ. Applied Sciences H-DA (Germany), Univ. Groningen (Netherlands), IDIAP (Switzerland), Chalmers Univ. (Sweden), Katholieke Univ. Leuven (Belgium)</p>
 <p><b>Period:</b> January 2020 – December 2023</p>
 <p><b>Principal investigator(s):</b> Massimiliano Todisco (Julian Fierrez and Aythami Morales for UAM)</p>
 <p><b>Objectives:</b></p>
 <p>- To combat rising security challenges, the global market for biometric technologies is growing at a fast pace. It includes all processes used to recognise, authenticate and identify persons based on biological and/or behavioural characteristics.</p>
 <p>- The EU-funded TReSPAsS-ETN project will deliver a new type of security protection (through generalised presentation attack detection (PAD) technologies) and privacy preservation (through computationally feasible encryption solutions).</p>
 <p>- The TReSPAsS-ETN Marie Sklodowska-Curie early training network will couple specific technical and transferable skills training including entrepreneurship, innovation, creativity, management and communications with secondments to industry.</p>

<DIV align="left">
 <p><b>Title:</b> Identifying Digital Endpoints to Assess Fatigue, Sleep and Activities in Daily Living in Neurodegenerative Disorders and Immune-mediated Inflammatory Diseases</p>
 <p><b>Type:</b> H2020 Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 (IMI2) - Research and Innovation Action (RIA)</p>
 <p><b>Code:</b> H2020-JTI-IMI2-2018-15-two-stage-853981</p>
 <p><b>Funding:</b> ca. 40 Meuros in total (ca. 200 Keuros for UAM)</p>
 <p><b>Participants:</b> UAM + 44 more: Janssen, Takeda, Lilly, Pfizer, Sanofi, ECRIN, Cambridge Cognition, Asociación de Parkinson Madrid, Imperial College London, etc.</p>
 <p><b>Period:</b> November 2019 - April 2025</p>
 <p><b>Principal investigator(s):</b> Fai Ng from Newcastle Univ., UK (Julian Fierrez for UAM)</p>
 <p><b>Objectives:</b></p>
 <p>- Fatigue and sleep disturbances are two common and disabling symptoms that affect patients with neurodegenerative disorders (NDD) and immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID). These symptoms are major predictors of poor quality of life and increased healthcare cost. Current questionnaire-based approaches to measure these symptoms have key limitations preventing them from being used as reliable endpoints in clinical trials to evaluate the effect of therapies.</p>
 <p>- IDEA-FAST aims to address these issues by identifying novel digital endpoints for fatigue and sleep disturbances that will provide more objective, sensitive and reliable measures of the severity and impact of these symptoms in ecological settings. Such digital endpoints will not only help to gain insight into the underpinning mechanisms of fatigue and sleep disturbances, but will also vastly improve the efficiency of clinical trials, ultimately reducing the time and cost to bring new therapies to patients.</p>
 <p>- To identify these digital endpoints, we will follow the recommendations of the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI). We will identify the characteristics that fatigue and sleep disturbances will have impact, then select the digital measures (endpoints) to quantify them, followed by choosing the appropriate digital device/technology accordingly. We will then perform a pilot study to prioritise a few of these candidate digital endpoints for validation. We will test the performance of these digital endpoints in two NDD and four IMID in a large longitudinal study during which extensive relevant clinical data will be collected. If these digital endpoints were validated, we will seek support from EMA/FDA for their qualification. Patient users’ perspective, ethical, data privacy, legal and other regulatory issues will be taken into consideration in all aspects of our proposal.</p>
 <p>- The resultant digital biobank from the longitudinal study will become an invaluable resource for future exploitation.</p>
