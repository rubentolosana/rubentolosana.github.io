<p> 
<DIV align="left">
 <p><b>Title:</b> Identifying Digital Endpoints to Assess Fatigue, Sleep and Activities in Daily Living in Neurodegenerative Disorders and Immune-mediated Inflammatory Diseases</p>
 <p><b>Type:</b> H2020 Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 (IMI2) - Research and Innovation Action (RIA)</p>
 <p><b>Code:</b> H2020-JTI-IMI2-2018-15-two-stage-853981</p>
 <p><b>Funding:</b> ca. 40 Meuros in total (ca. 200 Keuros for UAM)</p>
 <p><b>Participants:</b> UAM + 44 more: Janssen, Takeda, Lilly, Pfizer, Sanofi, ECRIN, Cambridge Cognition, Asociación de Parkinson Madrid, Imperial College London, etc.</p>
 <p><b>Period:</b> November 2019 - April 2025</p>
 <p><b>Principal investigator(s):</b> Fai Ng from Newcastle Univ., UK (<u>Julian Fierrez</u> for UAM)</p>
 <p><b>Objectives:</b></p>
 <p>- Fatigue and sleep disturbances are two common and disabling symptoms that affect patients with neurodegenerative disorders (NDD) and immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID). These symptoms are major predictors of poor quality of life and increased healthcare cost. Current questionnaire-based approaches to measure these symptoms have key limitations preventing them from being used as reliable endpoints in clinical trials to evaluate the effect of therapies.</p>
 <p>- IDEA-FAST aims to address these issues by identifying novel digital endpoints for fatigue and sleep disturbances that will provide more objective, sensitive and reliable measures of the severity and impact of these symptoms in ecological settings. Such digital endpoints will not only help to gain insight into the underpinning mechanisms of fatigue and sleep disturbances, but will also vastly improve the efficiency of clinical trials, ultimately reducing the time and cost to bring new therapies to patients.</p>
 <p>- To identify these digital endpoints, we will follow the recommendations of the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI). We will identify the characteristics that fatigue and sleep disturbances will have impact, then select the digital measures (endpoints) to quantify them, followed by choosing the appropriate digital device/technology accordingly. We will then perform a pilot study to prioritise a few of these candidate digital endpoints for validation. We will test the performance of these digital endpoints in two NDD and four IMID in a large longitudinal study during which extensive relevant clinical data will be collected. If these digital endpoints were validated, we will seek support from EMA/FDA for their qualification. Patient users’ perspective, ethical, data privacy, legal and other regulatory issues will be taken into consideration in all aspects of our proposal.</p>
 <p>- The resultant digital biobank from the longitudinal study will become an invaluable resource for future exploitation.</p>

 <p><b>Title:</b> Biometrics Evaluation and Testing</p>
 <p><b>Type:</b> FP7-SECURITY, CP-FP: Small or Medium-scale Focused Research Project</p>
 <p><b>Code:</b> SEC-2011.5.1-1-284989</p>
 <p><b>Funding:</b> ca. 3.5 Meuros (ca. 530 Keuros for UAM)</p>
 <p><b>Participants:</b> 10 EU Institutions, including Univ. Autonoma de Madrid </p>
 <p><b>Period:</b> March 2012 - February 2016</p>
 <p><b>Principal investigator(s):</b> Sebastien Marcel (<u>Julian Fierrez</u> for UAM)</p> 
 <p><b>Objectives:</b></p>
 <p>- Identity management using Biometrics is deployed in a growing number of applications ranging from identification platforms (e.g. biometric passports) to access control systems for border checks or banking transactions. Unfortunately, the reliability of these technologies remains difficult to compare. There are no european-wide standards for evaluating their accuracy, their robustness to attacks or their privacy preservation strength.</p>
 <p>- BEAT will fill this gap by building an online and open platform to transparently evaluate biometric systems, designing protocols and tools for vulnerability analysis and developing standardization documents for Common Criteria evaluations. The planned impact is three-fold: the reliability of biometric systems becomes standardized and comparable, potentially leading to a meaningful increase in their performance; technology transfer from research to companies becomes easier with the use of an interoperable framework; authorities and decision-makers become more informed about the progress made in biometrics as results impact standards.</p>
