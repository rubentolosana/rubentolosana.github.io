About me
======

<div style="text-align: justify">I received the M.Sc. degree in Telecommunication Engineering, and the Ph.D. degree in Computer and Telecommunication Engineering, from Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, in 2014 and 2019, respectively. In 2014, I joined the Biometrics and Data Pattern Analytics - BiDA Lab at the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, where I'm currently Associate Professor. I'm a member of the <a href="https://ellis.eu/" target="_blank">ELLIS Society</a> (European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems) and <a href="https://ellismadrid.es/" target="_blank">ELLIS Unit Madrid</a>, Technical Area Committee of <a href="https://eurasip.org/" target="_blank">EURASIP</a> (European Association For Signal Processing), and Editorial Board of the <a href="http://ieee-biometrics.org/index.php/publications/newsletter" target="_blank">IEEE Biometrics Council Newsletter</a>. My research interests are mainly focused on signal and image processing, pattern recognition, and machine learning, particularly in the areas of DeepFakes, Human-Computer Interaction, Biometrics, and Health. I'm the author of more than 100 scientific articles published in international journals and conferences. I have served as General Chair and Program Chair (AVSS 2022), and Area Chair (IJCB 2023, ICPR 2022) in top conferences. I have also received several awards such as the "European Biometrics Industry Award (2018)" from the <a href="https://eab.org/" target="_blank">European Association for Biometrics (EAB)</a>, the "Best Ph.D. Thesis Award in 2019-2022" from the <a href="https://www.aerfai.org/" target="_blank">Spanish Association for Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis (AERFAI)</a>, and the "Juan Lopez de Peñalver Award (2024)" from the <a href="https://www.raing.es/" target="_blank">Spanish Royal Academy of Engineering (RAING)</a> for my research contributions and transfer of technologies. </div>
