About me
======

<div style="text-align: justify">I received the M.Sc. degree in Telecommunication Engineering, and the Ph.D. degree in Computer and Telecommunication Engineering, from Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, in 2014 and 2019, respectively. In 2014, I joined the Biometrics and Data Pattern Analytics - BiDA Lab at the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, where I'm currently Assistant Professor. I'm a member of the <a href="https://ellis.eu/" target="_blank">ELLIS Society</a> (European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems) and Editorial Board of the <a href="http://ieee-biometrics.org/index.php/publications/newsletter" target="_blank">IEEE Biometrics Council Newsletter</a>. My research interests are mainly focused on signal and image processing, pattern recognition, and machine learning, particularly in the areas of DeepFakes, Human-Computer Interaction, Biometrics, and Health. </div>
