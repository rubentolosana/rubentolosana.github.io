About me
======

<div style="text-align: justify">I received the M.Sc. degree in Telecommunication Engineering, and the Ph.D. degree in Computer and Telecommunication Engineering, from Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, in 2014 and 2019, respectively. In 2014, I joined the Biometrics and Data Pattern Analytics - BiDA Lab at the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, where I'm currently Assistant Professor. I'm also a member of the [ELLIS Society](https://ellis.eu/members) and Editorial Board of the [IEEE Biometrics Council Newsletter](http://ieee-biometrics.org/index.php/publications/newsletter).
  
  My research interests are mainly focused on signal and image processing, pattern recognition, and machine learning, particularly in the areas of DeepFakes, Human-Computer Interaction, Biometrics, and Health. </div>
