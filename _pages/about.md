About me
======

<div style="text-align: justify">I received the M.Sc. degree in Telecommunication Engineering, and the Ph.D. degree in Computer and Telecommunication Engineering, from Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, in 2014 and 2019, respectively. In 2014, I joined the Biometrics and Data Pattern Analytics - BiDA Lab at the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, where I'm currently Assistant Professor. I'm a member of the <a href="https://ellis.eu/" target="_blank">ELLIS Society</a> (European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems), Technical Area Committee of <a href="https://eurasip.org/" target="_blank">EURASIP</a> (European Association For Signal Processing), and Editorial Board of the <a href="http://ieee-biometrics.org/index.php/publications/newsletter" target="_blank">IEEE Biometrics Council Newsletter</a>. My research interests are mainly focused on signal and image processing, pattern recognition, and machine learning, particularly in the areas of DeepFakes, Human-Computer Interaction, Biometrics, and Health. I have received several awards such as the European Biometrics Industry Award (2018) from the <a href="https://eab.org/" target="_blank">European Association for Biometrics (EAB)</a> and the Best Ph.D. Thesis Award in 2019-2022 from the <a href="https://www.aerfai.org/" target="_blank">Spanish Association for Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis (AERFAI).</a> </div>
